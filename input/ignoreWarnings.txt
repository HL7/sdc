# We don't assign OIDs to example artifacts that aren't intended for real use
INFORMATION: Resource: This resource could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)

# The intention here is to provide an example of what a Questionnaire with a contained code system would look like
%CodeSystems are referred to directly from Coding.system, so it's generally best for them not to be contained resources

# This is inherited from CQLLibrary
WARNING: StructureDefinition/sdc-library: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[17].fixed.ofType(CodeableConcept): For the complex type CodeableConcept, consider using a pattern rather than a fixed value to avoid over-constraining the instance
