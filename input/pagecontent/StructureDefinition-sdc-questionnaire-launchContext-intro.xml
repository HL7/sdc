  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    If a name is specified other than one of those specified in the value set, systems will have to come to prior agreement and 
    write code to support the additional name.  It will not be possible to dynamically automatically support new launch contexts 
    without writing custom code. In addition, 'custom' names SHOULD have a prefix such that they won't collide with new standard 
    context names introduced by future versions of SDC.
