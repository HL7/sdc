  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile adds additional constraints and extensions to the base <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire.html">SDC Base Questionnaire Profile</a> that support
    generating and potentially partially populating a questionnaire response using existing FHIR resource data.  This profile identifies which core elements
    and extensions must be supported when using the <a href="populate.html#map-pop">StructureMap-based</a> population mechanism and highlights other elements that, while not required, may be relevant to the questionnaire response population
    use-case.  Further information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance on the elements and extensions included in the profile can be
    found on the <a href="populate.html">Questionnaire Population</a> page.
