  <h3>Derived Questionnaires</h3>
  <p>
    It is possible to construct Questionnaires that are derived from a 'parent' Questionnaire.  The derived Questionnaire is fully compatible with the base Questionnaire, but it
    may make certain changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It might remove certain optional items (see the <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-optionalDisplay.html">optionalDisplay</a> extension)</li>
    <li>It might introduce additional extensions that allow the Questionnaire to be populated and/or extracted</li>
    <li>It might tighten rendering expectations to align with the capabilities of particular rendering tools</li>
    <li>It might provide translations of the Questionnaire into alternate languages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In all cases, the answers to the derived Questionnaire must be valid as answers against the 'base' Questionnaire.  It is also legal for the QuestionnaireResponse.questionnaire
    to point to the base Questionnaire rather than the derived Questionnaire.  A Questionnaire indicates that it is derived by pointing to the base Questionnaire using
    <code>Questionnaire.derivedFrom</code>.  In this scenario, there must be exactly one 'derivedFrom' form specified.
