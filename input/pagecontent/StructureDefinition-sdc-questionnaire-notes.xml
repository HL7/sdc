  <h3>Derived Questionnaires</h3>
  <p>
    It is possible to construct Questionnaires that are derived from a 'parent' Questionnaire.  The derived Questionnaire is fully compatible with the base Questionnaire, but it
    may make certain changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It might remove certain optional items (see the <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-optionalDisplay.html">optionalDisplay</a> extension)</li>
    <li>It might introduce additional extensions that allow the Questionnaire to be populated and/or extracted</li>
    <li>It might tighten rendering expectations to align with the capabilities of particular rendering tools</li>
    <li>It might provide translations of the Questionnaire into alternate languages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In all cases, the answers to the derived Questionnaire must be valid as answers against the 'base' Questionnaire.  It is also legal for the QuestionnaireResponse.questionnaire
    to point to the base Questionnaire rather than the derived Questionnaire.  A Questionnaire indicates that it is derived by pointing to the base Questionnaire using
    <code>Questionnaire.derivedFrom</code>.  In this scenario, there must be exactly one 'derivedFrom' form specified.
  </p>
	<a name="language"> </a>
	<h3>Language and translations</h3>
	<p>
    In some environments, it may be necessary for a questionnaire to support multiple languages.  The rendering tool would select the appropriate
    language based on a configuration setting, or perhaps would display all available languages and the user would read the one they are familiar with.
    Systems MAY choose to provide support for identifying language and translations.  If they do, they MAY do so using the generic language and
    translation extensions FHIR defines based on the ISO21090 data type specification:
  </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-iso21090-st-language.html">iso21090-st-language</a> allows the language of a particular (or any other data type)
       to be identified</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://hl7.org/Profile/extension-iso21090-st-translation">iso21090-st-translation</a> allows additional repetitions in alternate languages to be communicated.
      (The language for each translation would be communicated using the above #language extension)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
    These extensions can be used on absolutely any string element on <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a>,
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}valueset.html">ValueSet</a>, or any other resource.  The base string should be the primary language of the questionnaire.  It is what will be rendered by systems that do
    not support the translation extension or by systems whose language preference is other than one of the languages provided.
  </p>
	<p>
    The ISO 19763 specification permits declaring language on questionnaire titles, descriptions, display names for codes and many other strings.  It also supports
    capturing multiple variants of these strings with distinct languages.  These capabilities can be mirrored using the above extensions.
  </p>
	<p>
    An alternative is to define an extension to the <b>Questionnaire</b> providing a pointer to an externally maintained set of extensions.  This approach allows
    the translations to be maintained independently of the resource which has both positive and negative impacts, particularly with respect to resource signature.
  </p>
	<p>
		<b>Open Issue:</b> Should this profile define such an extension and/or a resource for managing such translations?
