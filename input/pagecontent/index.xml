  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
   Paper forms exist all over healthcare.  They get filled out by patients, relatives, administrators, clinicians - essentially everyone.  The FHIR
   standard defines some basic ways share forms (empty ones and completed ones), however it only supports the capabilities that almost all forms need 
   to have.  This implementation guide defines additional capabilities, including the ability to automatically fill in some of the form answers with 
   information that might already have been entered somewhere else, the ability to automatically calculate certain fields like age, the ability to 
   better control what a form looks like, etc.  It defines a wide variety of 'features' covering different aspects of forms (how forms look, how they 
   behave, what types of systems can use forms and what they can do with them, etc.)  The intent is to help ensure that different types of systems that 
   implement the same 'feature' do so in the same way.
  </p>
  <a name="scope"> </a>
  <h3>Scope and purpose</h3>
	<p>
    Questionnaires are used to capture administrative data, claims data, clinical information, research information,
    for public health reporting - every type of data that is manipulated by healthcare systems.  They provide a user-friendly mechanism for capturing data
    in a consistent way.  In FHIR, forms are represented using the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a> resource and
    completed forms are represented using the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> resource.  The base FHIR
    specification defines these resources but does not provide much guidance around how they should be used, nor does it set minimal expectations for
    interoperation.  This implementation guide provides a set of guidance around the use of Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse that support many
    additional capabilities that provide benefits to providers, patients and other users.  These capabilities cover 7 major areas:
  </p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="workflow.html">Workflow considerations</a>: This section helps drive improved interoperability across different systems that make
      use of questionnaires by helping to answer questions like these:
      <ul>
        <li>What are the types of systems involved in designing, managing, completing, receiving, and otherwise processing forms?</li>
        <li>How should these types of systems be expected to interact and what capabilities should they have?</li>
        <li>How do you ask someone to fill out a form (and keep track of whether they have or not)?</li>
      </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li><a href="search.html">Finding Questionnaires</a>: Typically, the form that needs to be filled out in a particular situation will be known
      in advance.  However, if you're dealing with an electronic registry of forms, there needs to be standards on how to find the appropriate
      form to use.
	  </li>
	  <li><a href="rendering.html">Rendering considerations</a>: This extends and provides guidance about how to make form content appear to a user
      in the way a form author intends.  Examples include:
      <ul>
        <li>How can questions be organized into a table?</li>
        <li>How can colors, formatting and graphics be added to a Questionnaire?</li>
        <li>How can I control the way check-boxes or radio-buttons are organized?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="behavior.html">Enhanced behavior</a> gives guidance and defines additional capabilities that affect how a Questionnaire will interact
      with a user - the objective being to only gather relevant information and ensure that 'rules' around the Questionnaire are enforced.  For example:
      <ul>
        <li>How can the questions, options or even the text of the questions be changed based on what other answers have already been provided
          (or based on information the software already knows, such as age or gender of the patient).</li>
        <li>How can rules be enforced such as minimum and maximum values, required formatting for phone numbers, allowed targets for references, etc.?</li>
        <li>How can a Questionnaire automatically calculate scores or other values?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="populate.html">Automatic population</a> helps to reduce the pain of having to fill in the same information 'yet again' by allowing
      a form to automatically fill in answers already known to the EHR or other data source.  The user can then just verify that the information is still
      correct (and revise if necessary) rather than needing to fill out the information all over again (and possibly accidentally omitting or incorrectly
      entering some of it</li>
    <li><a href="extraction.html">Data extraction</a> allows data captured in a QuestionnaireResponse to be extracted and used to create or update other
      FHIR resources - allowing the data to be more easily searched, compared and used by other FHIR systems</li>
    <li><a href="modular.html">Modular forms</a> simplify the questionnaire maintenance process by allowing questions or sections of a Questionnaire to be 
      shared across multiple forms.  This also increases the consistency of questions and allows data to be more comparable.</li>
    <li><a href="adaptive.html">Adaptive forms</a> change form design from one where all questions and logic must be defined up-front and shared, to one
      where the form filling tool simply calls an API to determine what the next question should be.  This allows for form designs to be hidden and for
      complex flow control logic to be managed even when the software rendering the questionnaire is very simple.</li>
	</ul>
	<a name="conformance"> </a>
	<h3>Conformance expectations</h3>
	<p>
	  Obviously all of the above represents a <b>lot</b> of capability and not all systems will necessarily need to take on all of these features.  In fact,
	  it is unlikely that any one system will support <i>all</i> of the features defined in this guide.  Instead, each downstream implementation guide or implementer
	  will choose the specific subset of SDC features of interest and build those only.
	</p>
  <p>
    This guide defines a <a href="workflow.html#capabilitystatement">set of CapabilityStatements</a> setting required and suggested RESTful interface capabilities for 
    different types of systems that work with Questionnaires and QuestionnaireResponses.  Most implementers of this guide SHOULD conform to at least one of these.
    The guide also defines profiles.  These profiles fall into two categories:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Strict adherence profiles</b> such as the population, extraction, adaptive forms, and modular forms profiles SHALL be complied with by systems that wish to
      implement the associated functionality and claim SDC compliance.</li>
    <li><b>Advisory profiles</b> MAY be used directly or derived from, but may also be used as the inspiration for other profiles that include the specific combinations
      of features that are needed.  The elements marked as 'mustSupport' in those profiles are strongly encouraged to be supported, but a system that develops its own
      profiles that excludes some or all of the mustSupport elements can still be considered conformant with SDC.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In many cases, when complying with SDC, a system may wish to comply with multiple profiles at once.  For example, an implementer may need advanced rendering, advanced
    behavior, population, and extraction all in a single Questionnaire.  When creating a profile, it is not possible to inherit from multiple profiles at once.  However,
    it <i>is</i> possible to use extensions in your profile, either to assert an <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.ext}}StructureDefinition-structuredefinition-imposeProfile.html">expectation 
    for compliance with additional profiles</a> or to manually re-assert the same set of constraints and then assert that the elements in the profile
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.ext}}StructureDefinition-structuredefinition-compliesWithProfile.html">meet the requirements of a reference profile</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This IG can also be used as a tool-box of extensions and approaches that an implementation or downstream IG could use as 'inspiration' to their own set of
    profiles and CapabilityStatements that don't declare conformance with SDC at all.  (Though referencing SDC as a source of additional information and to provide
    credit is still encouraged.)
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have used SDC in the definition of Questionnaires that are publicly available, we encourage you to provide links to them on our 
    <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIRI/Questionnaire+Examples+page">SDC Usage Confluence page</a>.  If you don't have edit access to HL7's Confluence site, you 
    can submit a request to add a link with a post to the <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179255-questionnaire">Questionnaire stream</a> on http://chat.fhir.org.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future versions of this IG may explore additional mechanisms to support implementers who wish to conform with specific common and useful subsets of SDC and combine them
    in arbitrary ways, likely using the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.ext}}StructureDefinition-obligation.html">obligation</a> extension.

	<h3>Navigation</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide follows the FHIR pattern of being published as a web-based specification.  This
    allows easy navigation between the SDC-specific portion of the implementation guide and the resources,
    data types, value sets and other specification components leveraged from the FHIR core specification.  This
    approach also allows implementers to easily navigate to the information needed to perform a task.
  </p>
	<p>
    A <a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a> page is provided that lists all of the pages defined as part of this implementation guide.  (Do be aware
    that some pages have multiple tabs.)  A table of contents is also available for the full <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}toc.html">FHIR specification</a>
    if you really want to read absolutely everything.  There's also an <a href="artifacts.html">Artifact index</a> that lists all formal FHIR artifacts
    defined within this implementation guide.  The <i>Support</i> menu provides links to the HL7 standards used by this implementation guide as well as
    providing a <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> link to retrieve a local copy of this implementation guide and/or particular subsets of it.
  </p>
	<p>
    Bread-crumb navigation is provided in the gray bar just below the menu at the top of each page, allowing
    easy navigation back to the main SDC page.
  </p>
	<p>This implementation guide is organized into two sets of sections: SDC Background and the SDC Specification</p>
	<a name="background"> </a>
	<h4>SDC Background</h4>
	<p>
    These sections provide information relevant to all SDC implementers, regardless of which SDC capabilities they're interested in using.

	<h3>Boundaries and Relationships</h3>
	<p>
    In addition to defining its own extensions, this implementation guide leverages extensions defined in the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}">core
    specification.</a>  The definitions of these extensions can be found in the following sections. (Note - not all extensions from these sections are
    relevant.  Relevant extensions are noted in each SDC profile, along with an indication of whether the extensions must be supported or not.)
	</p>
	<ul>
    <li>
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire-extensions.html">questionnaire-extensions</a> defines several less common properties for
      questionnaire, group and question, several of which are mandated for this profile.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}element-extensions.html">element-extensions</a> defines extensions describing constraints on the values for
      data elements (e.g. field length, min and max values, etc.). These are used here to constrain the allowed values for questions.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}general-extensions.html">general-extensions</a> provides an extension for strings allowing the conveying of
      translations, which may be relevant in some environments.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}rendering-extensions.html">rendering-extensions</a> defines properties to give fine-grained control over
      how questions, labels and other strings are rendered, such as providing HTML or markdown equivalents.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}codesystem-extensions.html">codesystem-extensions</a> defines several less common properties for value sets,
       several of which are mandated for this profile. It also makes use of the rendering-extensions which define rendering information for
       display names and labels of codes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It is expected that a variety of IGs will refine various combinations of SDC functionality and publish additional profiles to meet the needs of
    their specific Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse use-cases.

  <h3>Dependencies</h3>
  <p>
    This guide also relies on a number of parent implementation guides:
  </p>
 
  {% include dependency-table-nontech.xhtml %}

  <p>
    This implementation guide defines additional constraints and usage expectations above and beyond the information found in these base specifications.
  </p>
  
	<a name="ip"> </a>
	<h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
	<p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide includes examples making use of terminologies such
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others that have more restrictive licensing requirements.  Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process.  In some cases,
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
