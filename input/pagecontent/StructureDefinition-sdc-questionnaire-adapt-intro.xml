  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile inherits from the base <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a> It identifies core elements and extensions that must be supported and highlights other elements that, while not
    required, may be relevant to the adaptive questionnaire use-case.  Further information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance on
    the elements and extensions included in the profile can be found on the <a href="adaptive.html">Adaptive Forms</a> page.
  </p>
  <p>
    This profile is only used within an adaptive QuestionnaireResponse.  For an adaptive Questionnaire found on a registry or otherwise returned as a 'candidate' for completion, refer to the <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-adapt-srch.html">Adaptive Questionnaire Search</a> profile.
