  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    The UsageContext data type allows categorizing artifacts in a wide variety of ways, but doesn't provide much guidance one what aspects should be supported, what data types are relevant
    to which types of context, or what value sets are appropriate for coded contexts.  This profile tightens down the data type to reflect expectations for use in Questionnaire registries.
