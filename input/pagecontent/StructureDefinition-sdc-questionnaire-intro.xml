  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile sets base expectations for use of the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a> resource in all use-cases
    supported by this implementation guide.  It forms foundation for most other Questionnaire profiles within this guide and represents information that is
    going to be necessary regardless of how the Questionnaire is being used.  It identifies which core elements and extensions must be
    supported and highlights other elements that, while not required, may be relevant to the Questionnaire use-cases.
