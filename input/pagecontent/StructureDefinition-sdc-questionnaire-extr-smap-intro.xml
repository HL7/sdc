  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile adds additional constraints and extensions to the base <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire.html">SDC Base Questionnaire Profile</a> that support
    extracting information from questionnaire responses and producing other FHIR resources.  This profile identifies which core elements and extensions must
    be supported when using the <a href="extraction.html#map-extract">StructureMap-based</a> extraction mechanism and highlights other elements that, while not required, may be relevant to the questionnaire response data extraction use-case.  Further
    information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance on the elements and extensions included in the profile can be found on the
    <a href="extraction.html">Data Extraction</a> page.
