  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile adds additional constraints and extensions to the base <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire.html">SDC Base Questionnaire Profile</a> that support
    the design of questionnaires with more sophisticated behavior and flow-control, including calculated values, determining what portions of the questionnaire
    to show based on previous answers, etc.  This profile identifies which core elements
    and extensions must be supported and highlights other elements that, while not required, may be relevant to the questionnaire response population
    use-case.  Further information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance on the elements and extensions included in the profile can be
    found on the <a href="behavior.html">Form Behavior</a> page.
