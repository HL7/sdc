    Simple questionnaires only need simple behavior.  All questions get displayed in order.  The only 'behavior' defined in the questionnaire is whether a given 
	question must be answered and whether multiple answers are permitted or not.  However, for more sophisticated forms, there may be a need to set default answers, enforce rules around the allowed answers (such as length, size, types of references), and/or to make the behavior of the questionnaire dynamic based on 
	previous answers.  The FHIR specification provides core elements that allow some of these things, and common extensions for others.  This implementation guide 
	supplements the core FHIR specification with additional extensions.  It also defines the <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-behave.html">sdc-questionnaire-behave</a> 
	profile to highlight what extensions are available and where they are intended to be used.  It also identifies specific 'must support' extensions that systems 
	that claim to support SDC rendering SHALL be capable of authoring and/or rendering, as befits the CapabilityStatement(s) they claim conformance to.  An example for <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-behave.html">sdc-questionnaire-behave</a> profile can be found <a href="Questionnaire-questionnaire-sdc-profile-example-form-behavior.html">here</a>.

	<h3>Element and  Overview</h3>
	<p>
    The following sub-sections describe the different core elements and extensions available to control the 'behavior' of a questionnaire.
    Each extension includes the following information:
  </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Code:</b> This is the name of the core element or the unique label for the extension.  The extension label appears at the end of the URL of the
      'source' (below).  In this implementation guide, extensions are generally just referred to by their code.</li>
		<li>
			<b>Source:</b> This will either be 'N/A', 'Core', 'Questionnaire' or 'SDC'.  'N/A' indicates that the element is part of the core spec, not an extension.
      'Core' indicates that the extension is defined in the core specification and is not
      specific to the Questionnaire resource.  The base URL for 'core' extensions is <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/</code>.  Questionnaire
      indicates an extension defined in the core specification that is specific to Questionnaires.  The base URL for 'Questionnaire' extensions is
      <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-</code>.  SDC extensions are defined within this implementation guide.  Their base URL
      is <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Location:</b> This indicates where the element or extension can appear.  Possible values are 'Questionnaire' (for those that appear directly on the
      <code>Questionnaire</code> element), 'item' (for those that can appear on any type of item), 'question' (for those that can only appear on question
      items), or 'group' (for those that can appear on group items).  In some cases, additional restrictions/guidance will be provided.</li>
		<li>
			<b>Data Type:</b> Indicates what content the element or extension can have.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
    Both core elements and extensions will have explanatory text that provides additional guidance on how the extension is used.
  </p>
	<a name="value-constraint"> </a>
	<h4>Value constraints</h4>
	<p>
    These elements all constrain the allowed values for answers to Questionnaires.

            This core element is typically used with strings, but can theoretically be used for other variable-length simple types (e.g. to limit the maximum

            the maximum length of the answer in characters.  Be aware that in UTF-8, some characters may take multiple bytes, so maxLength does not place a
            specific constraint on the maximum number of bytes.  If not specified, the maximum length is established by the data type.  (For example, in FHIR

            This allows constraining the allowed value for a question item's answer to an enumerated set.  Each answerOption repetition indicates one of the
            possible allowed values.  The answer to the question, if answered, SHALL match one of the specified repetitions unless the item.type is
            open-choice. The type of the answerOption must match the type of the question. (Coding is used for both choice and open-choice.)
          </p>
					<p>
            There are three mechanisms to enumerate the permitted answers for a question: this element, the <a href="#answerValueSet">answerValueSet</a>
            element, and the <a href="#answerExpression">answerExpression</a> extension.  answerValueSet only supports defining values for 'string' and 
            Coding elements.  (For 'string', the allowed values are those found in the value set expansion's 'code' elements.)  However, it allows for the 
            set of allowed codes to be maintained as an expression such as "all medications from SNOMED CT", automatically adjusting as the set of matching codes 
            changes based on the evolution of the code system.  As such,
            answerValueSet is appropriate when the set of codes is large or potentially dynamic and enumerating all the possible choices within the
            Questionnaire does not make sense.  To have tighter control of the set of answers allowed for the question, consider making the reference to the
            ValueSet <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}references.html#canonical">version-specific</a>.  To really lock down the set of codes, the value
            set should itself tie itself to specific versions of the underlying code systems and/or specify a
            <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.compose.lockedDate">lockedDate</a>.
          </p>
					<p>
						<code>answerValueSet</code> also allows for the possibility of sharing a set of answers across multiple questions within a single Questionnaire.
            Sharing the set of allowed answers simplifies maintenance and ensures consistency across questions.  This can be important when representing
            choices as columns or rows in a table (see <a href="rendering.html#itemControl">itemControl</a>).  If appropriate, the ValueSet can be nested
            inside the Questionnaire as a <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}references.html#contained">contained</a> resource.  This should only be done if
            the ValueSet is intrinsically tied to the Questionnaire and should only ever be edited in the context of the Questionnaire.  Such ValueSets will
            not be available for use elsewhere.
          </p>
					<p>
						<code>answerOption</code> works well when there is a small (2 - 20ish) number of choices and if the question type is integer,
            date, time or reference.  The set of options is maintained independently for each question.
          </p>
					<p>
            The third mechanism for capturing the allowed set of answers is by using the <code>answerExpression</code> extension.  This extension allows
            specifying a FHIR Query, FHIRPath, or CQL expression that resolves to a list of permitted answers for a question item.  The expression must 
            evaluate to a collection of elements with the same type as the item.type or, if the type was Reference, to resources allowed as the referenced type.
            For more details on answerExpression, click <a href="expressions.html#answerExpression">here</a>.
          </p>
					<p>
            These three mechanisms are mutually exclusive.  Only one SHOULD appear on the same question.  If
            <code>answerOption</code> appears, there SHOULD be more than one repetition of it.  A question with a single answerOption will be treated as
            having a single fixed value.
          </p>
					<p>
            If the set of choices is restricted using any of these three mechanisms, the use of any other <a href="#value-constraint">Value Constraint</a> elements is 
            redundant and confusing.  Therefore, questions that have  'answerOption', 'answerValueSet' or 'answerExpression' extension SHALL NOT make use of any of the 
            other Value Constraint extensions.

            The <a href="#required">required</a> element allows distinguishing items that are optional (minOccurs=0) from those that are required (minOccurs=1).
            However, for elements where <a href="#repeats">repeats</a> is true, it's sometimes necessary to indicate that multiple repetitions are required.
            For example, a question might ask the user to "select your top 3 choices" and want to enforce that at least 3 choices had been chosen.  The
            minOccurs extension allows such rules to be enforced.  Using the <a href="#cqf-calculatedValue">cqf-calculatedValue</a> extension or the <a href="#cqf-expression">cqf-expression</a> extension, 
            the minimum number of repetitions can also be made dynamic.  For example, one question might ask "How many brothers and sisters did you have?" while a
            subsequent repeating group captures information about each sibling.  The Questionnaire could enforce that the number of group repetitions matched the
            number of siblings indicated by setting minOccurs and <a href="#maxOccurs">maxOccurs</a>.

            This controls which questions, groups and even display items should be displayed based on answers to other questions within the response.
            An item is 'enabled' based on whether the referenced questions have one (or more) of the answers as specified by the enableWhen element.  If
            multiple enableWhen elements are present on an item, the interpretation is governed by the <a href="#enableBehavior">enableBehavior</a> element.
            Elements that are not enabled should either be hidden from the user or at least grayed-out and non-selectable and non-editable.  Any behavioral
            constraints associated with non-enabled elements (such as <a href="#required">required</a> or <a href="#minOccurs">minOccurs</a> are ignored and
            no answers are stored for non-enabled content.

            'enabled' or not, but can handle more sophisticated circumstances than that extension.  For example, it is possible to calculate a score based on the answer to several questions 
            and then enable other questions based on the score.  It's also possible to enable or disable questions based on data passed in as context or retrieved from queries.

            This extension is similar to <a href="#enableWhen">enableWhen</a> in that it enables or disables elements within the Questionnaire.  However,
            rather than being driven by data within the form or queried or passed from outside, it is instead driven by how the QuestionnaireResponse is
            being used.  Specifically, it allows certain elements to be enabled or disabled based on whether the form is being completed or whether it's
            being rendered after being completed.  When being rendered after completion, it also allows questions and groups to be suppressed if they are
            'empty'.  For example, the extension might hide data entry instructions when displaying a completed form and might hide 'interpretation'
            instructions when performing data entry.  It might also hide a score during data entry, but make it visible once the form is ready to be reviewed.

            This allows assertion of constraints across an entire questionnaire or across any item with child items.  All 'error' constraints SHALL evaluate to 'true' 
            before setting a QuestionnaireResponse to complete.  For example, it could be used to require that either the patient identifier or birth date must be 
            specified, that at least 6 of the questions from question 10 through 20 must be answered, or that the sum of questions 1 through 5 must equal exactly 100.  
            The human field SHOULD be set to inform the user what to do.  The expression is written in FHIRPath and has access to the <a href="expressions.html#fhirpath">additional FHIRPath capabilities</a> defined in

            This allows a form to indicate whether the form must be signed on completion or whether specified questions or answers themselves must be
            signed.  If a signature is required, elements present in the QuestionnaireResponse must have signatures before marking the QuestionnaireResponse
            as complete.  Signature can be as simple as providing the user's initials to confirm that they've verified and agree with the answer, or it could
            mean a full digital signature.  This extension will tend to be used on Questionnaires that result in legal documents.
