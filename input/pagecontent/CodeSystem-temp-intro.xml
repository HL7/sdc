    <p>
      The contents of this code system are in the process of migrating to their official home on <a href="http://terminology.hl7.org">http://terminology.hl7.org</a> (THO).  
      Implementers <b>SHOULD</b> monitor for the creation of equivalent codes there and, once available, send them as an additional 'coding' repetition alongside these
      temporary codes, and when receiving data, be prepared to accept either the SDC temporary code or the new 'permanent' code.  This will ease migration to future
      releases of SDC where this code system will be deprecated and eventually retired.  The codes are expected to migrate as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For the Task-related codes, the FHIR R5 core spec defines code systems for both <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/codesystem-task-code.html">Task codes</a> and <a href="">Task input and output codes</a>.  Both of these will be moving to THO in the first half of 2026.  The SDC codes for Questionnaire task will be added to the new equivalent code systems.</li>
      <li>The Library code will be added to the existing <a href="https://terminology.hl7.org/7.0.1/CodeSystem-library-type.html">Library Type</a> code system.</li>
    </ul>
