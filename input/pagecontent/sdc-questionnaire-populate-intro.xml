  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile expands adds additional constraints and extensions to the <a href="sdc-questionnaire.html">base SDC questionnaire profile</a> that support
    generating and potentially partially populating a questionnaire response using existing FHIR resource data.  This profile identifies which core elements 
    and extensions must be supported and highlights other elements that, while not required, may be relevant to the questionnaire response population 
    use-case.  Further information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance on on the elements and extensions included in the profile can be 
    found on the <a href="populate.html">Questionnaire Population</a> page.
