  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile extends the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}cqllibrary.html">CQL Library</a> Profile to support FHIRPath expressions and FHIR query 
    in addition to CQL as contents.  Note: This profile has similar elements with the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/StructureDefinition-cpg-computablelibrary.html">cpg-computablelibrary</a>
    Profile but could not be used as the base for this profile because of its 1..1 constraint on CQL as content.
