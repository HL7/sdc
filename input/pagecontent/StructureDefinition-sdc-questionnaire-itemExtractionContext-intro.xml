    <b>Note:</b> This extension has been superceded by the <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-definitionExtract.html">definitionExtract</a> extension.
    Please migrate to that extension, however this one will remain for backward compatibility.<br/>
    This extension does not support defining a profile to create, and the expression (x-fhir-query)
    was not deemed sufficiently implementable.
