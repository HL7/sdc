  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile adds additional constraints and extensions to the base <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire.html">SDC Base Questionnaire Profile</a> that support
    extracting information from questionnaire responses and producing other FHIR resources.  This profile identifies which core elements and extensions must
    be supported when using the <a href="extraction.html#definition-extract">Definition-based</a> extraction mechanism and highlights other elements that, while not required, may be relevant to the questionnaire response data extraction use-case.  Further
    information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance on the elements and extensions included in the profile can be found on the
    <a href="extraction.html#definition-extract">Data Extraction</a> page.

    <p>
      At present, Questionnaire.item.definition does not repeat, however there are use-cases where the same element could correspond to a data element in multiple data models.  <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-48941">Issue FHIR-48941</a> proposes changing this.  It will either happen by making a breaking change to the resource and changing the cardinality from 0..1 to 0..* or by adding a standard extension to allow capturing additional repetitions.  In either case, we expect this profile to be updated, either to support an inter-version extension allowing the additional repetitions or adding support for the new standard extension.  This will allow the same item to be used in multiple extractions.
