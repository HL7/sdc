    The base questionnaire resource provides limited capabilities around rendering.  The <code>label</code> and <code>text</code> elements for each item
    are rendered in order, possibly with renderer-specific styles reflecting whether they represent the label for a group, the content of a display item or
    the text of a question.  As well, the options for choice questions (whether enumerated or expressed as a value set) are made available to the user through
    renderer-determined controls.  In fact, the render makes the choice of controls to capture the answers to all question types.
  </p>
  <p>
    For many questionnaires, that's good enough.  However, for some types of forms, there's a need for the author to have greater control.  The core
    specification defines a few core elements and several extensions for this purpose - both questionnaire-specific as well as general-purpose that can
    appear in other places as well.   This implementation guide defines several more.  In addition, this guide defines the
    <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-render.html">sdc-questionnaire-render</a> profile which highlights what extensions are available and where they are intended
    to be used.  It also identifies specific 'must support' extensions that systems that claim to support SDC rendering <code>SHALL</code> be capable of authoring and/or
    rendering, as befits the CapabilityStatement(s) they claim conformance to. An example for <a href="StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-render.html">sdc-questionnaire-render</a> profile can be found <a href="Questionnaire-questionnaire-sdc-profile-example-render.html">here</a>.

  <h3>Extension Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The following sub-sections describe the different core elements and extensions available to control the 'rendering' of a questionnaire.
    Each extension includes the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Code:</b> This is the name of the core element or the unique label for the extension.  The extension label appears at the end of the URL of the
      'source' (below).  In this implementation guide, extensions are generally just referred to by their code.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Source:</b> This will either be 'N/A', 'Core', 'Questionnaire' or 'SDC'.  'N/A' indicates that the element is part of the core spec, not an extension.
      'Core' indicates that the extension is defined in the core specification and is not
      specific to the Questionnaire resource.  The base URL for 'core' extensions is <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/</code>.  Questionnaire
      indicates an extension defined in the core specification that is specific to Questionnaires.  The base URL for 'Questionnaire' extensions is
      <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-</code>.  SDC extensions are defined within this implementation guide.  Their base URL
      is <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Location:</b> This indicates where the element or extension can appear.  Possible values are 'Questionnaire' (for those that appear directly on the
      <code>Questionnaire</code> element), 'item' (for those that can appear on any type of item), 'question' (for those that can only appear on question
      items), or 'group' (for those that can appear on group items).  In some cases, additional restrictions/guidance will be provided.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Data Type:</b> Indicates what content the element or extension can have.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each extension will then have explanatory text that provides additional guidance on how the extension is used.

            elements such as bullets or even tables in item.text elements.  XHTML must be base64-encoded due to constraints on the values of extensions.
            For title and label, the XHTML should be an inline element, while text can also include block-level elements (paragraph, ul/ol, etc.).
            Conformant systems are allowed to ignore this extension unless it is declared as critical using the <a href="#sdc-rendering-criticalExtension">sdc-rendering-criticalExtension</a>

            render the display text (e.g. help-button or separate page for help text).  Regardless of the presence of itemControl, it can also influence the

            surrounding box.  The specific means of display are left open to the form filler, however systems that support this

      This extension provides a label to display beside free-text or unrestricted value input for an 'open' item. In FHIR R4, this applies to items of type <code>open-choice</code>. 
      In R5 (or when using inter-version extensions in pre-R5 environments), this applies to items where the <code>answerConstraint</code> element has a value other than <code>optionsOnly</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, it may display text such as <em>"Other, please specify"</em>, <em>"Additional condition"</em>, or <em>"More reason(s)"</em> adjacent to the free-form input box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following logic applies when determining applicability:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>R4:</strong> <code>ofType(ElementDefinition).type.exists(code='Coding') or where(%resource.is(Questionnaire)).exists(type.first()='open-choice' or (extension(...answerConstraint).exists() and extension(...answerConstraint).value!='answerOnly'))</code></li>

      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all renderings of 'open' elements will use such a label (e.g. an auto-complete style control won't have a separate label for entries that aren't in the list of options).

            relative position with respect to the question and answer and by what mechanism the display text should be rendered (fly-over, help-button,
            overlay on control or simple in-line text).  Finally, the 'question' items allow the choice of control for selecting an answer.  For choice,
            open-choice, and Reference items, it allows autocomplete, drop-down, check-box, radio-button and lookup controls.  For numerics, dates and times,

            This extension is used when users are selecting from a list of possible choices and there's a desire to control what information is displayed in
            the list of possible candidates.  It has two modes of operation:
          </p>
          <p>
            With choice and open-choice, it allows selection of display names and/or code system properties that should appear.  For example, if a
            'Medication' code system includes properties for form, preferred route and strength, that information could be displayed alongside the
            'display name' for the item.  Alternatively, a questionnaire might present the display names for the concept in English, Spanish and French.  The
            path is set to 'display' for the code's standard display name.  It's set to the property.code for a property value.  It's set to the language code
            for designations in a particular language (only works if there's only one designation for the language).  It's set to the designation use code for
            a selected designation (only works if there's only one designation for that use).
          </p>
          <p>
            With a Reference it allows selection of fields from the resource - for example the first name, last name and phone number of a provider.
            The path is the FHIRPath to navigate to the element from the resource root.  For example <code>name.first().given.first()</code> for the first
            name of a Patient or Practitioner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the item.type, multiple repetitions of the extension can be specified to indicate multiple columns.  The columns are displayed in
            the same order as the extensions appear on the Questionnaire.item.  For each column, the extension
            indicates the label to be displayed at the top of the column and the width of the column (following the same guidelines as for
            <a href="#width">width</a>).  It's also possible to indicate which column(s) should be used to construct the <code>Coding.display</code> or <code>Reference.display</code>
            value.  For choice and open-choice which map to Coding, only one extension repetition can have 'forDisplay' set to 'true'.  That column must either
            have a path of 'display' or must specify the language or use of a code designation (i.e. not a code property).  For Reference items, if multiple
            columns are marked with 'forDisplay', the display value used will be a space-separated concatenation of all columns so-marked.
          </p>
          <p>
            NOTE: If no 'forDisplay' columns are marked, or no columns are listed for a Reference questionnaire item, it's up to the form filler to decide
            what to display and what, if anything, to capture in the display element.

            Both groups and questions can be marked as repeating.  For groups, that means all content within the group can be repeated multiple times.
            The <a href="#itemControl">itemControl</a> extension can give specific guidance about this, for example treating each repetition as a row in a
            table.  Without guidance, it's up to the Form Filler to decide how to handle allowing the creation of additional repetitions (or their removal)
            and how to handle labeling the questions within - whether they should be repeated on each repetition or just listed once for the first occurrence.
          </p>
          <p>
            For questions that are marked as repeating, the results will be captured as multiple answers for one question.  In many cases, the question text
            will only need to appear once, and the user can fill in as many answers as they like.  However, for question items that contain nested questions,
            it may be necessary to repeat the question text for each repetition to ensure that it still appears on the user's screen.

            Technically there's no need to display a text box, drop-down or other controls if the value cannot be changed.  However, it's generally still
            desirable to use the same controls so that it's clear that the question answer is still an "answer" and so that read-only information does not
            stand out significantly from other answers.  However, there should still be a visual indicator that the element cannot be edited.  This might
            include changing the background color, changing the font for the question text or some similar visual cue.

            The 'hidden' option makes for a visually simpler form and may also avoid tempting users to change their answers based on what options were disabled based on their previous selections.  However, sometimes it is important that the user *does* have the ability to go back and change their answers if they realize that the disabled questions are relevant.

  <h3>Additional rendering considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Questionnaires will be rendered by a variety of tools on a variety of devices.  Not all tools will necessarily support all extensions - or even
      all core elements.  Authors should recognize this and only depend on rendering extensions if they're confident that all systems using the Questionnaire
      will support the needed extensions.  Note that this does not mean that extensions cannot be used, only that the Questionnaire should be safe to use if
      extensions that the author is not certain will be supported are not supported.  For example, avoid referring to 'the red text' if you're not certain
      the text will be rendered as red (and that those who are color-impaired will have an alternative mechanism of recognizing the text as 'red').</li>
    <li>Tools that use HTML to render forms should consider disabling browser-based auto-completion unless such behavior is desired</li>
  </ul>
  <a name="example"> </a>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>
    This implementation guide includes an <a href="Questionnaire-questionnaire-sdc-profile-example-render.html">example questionnaire</a>.  Each question in this
    questionnaire is itemized in the <a href="examples.html">Examples page</a> that shows how the extensions above are intended 
    to be used and identifies how such controls might appear in a rendered questionnaire.
  </p>
	<a name="language"> </a>
	<h3>Language and translations</h3>
	<p>
    In some environments, it may be necessary for a questionnaire to support multiple languages.  The rendering tool would select the appropriate
    language based on a configuration setting, or perhaps would display all available languages and the user would read the one they are familiar with.
    Systems MAY choose to provide support for identifying language and translations.  If they do, they MAY do so using the generic language and
    translation extensions FHIR defines:
  </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.ext}}/StructureDefinition-language.html">language</a> allows the language of a particular (or any other data type)
       to be identified</li>
		<li>
			<a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.ext}}/StructureDefinition-translation.html">translation</a> allows additional repetitions in alternate languages to be communicated.
      (The language for each translation would be communicated using the above <code>language</code> extension)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
    These extensions can be used on absolutely any string or markdown element on <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a>,
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}valueset.html">ValueSet</a>, or any other resource.  The base string should be the primary language of the questionnaire.  It is what will be rendered by systems that do
    not support the translation extension or by systems whose language preference is other than one of the languages provided.
  </p>
  <p>
    Work is underway to support a publishing process that allows maintenance of a set of language translations in separate 
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html">.po</a> files.  This will allow for translation strings to be maintained using
    the same syntax as commonly used by professional translators and then automatically re-incorporated into FHIR resources, either through the insertion of translation
    instructions, or by substituting the primary language with an alternative language.
  </p>
  <p>
    When work on this process is complete, it will be linked to on the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/How+to+add+translations+to+the+FHIR+Validator+and+IG+publisher">HL7
    Confluence page</a>.
