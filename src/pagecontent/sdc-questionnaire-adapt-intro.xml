  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile expands adds additional constraints and extensions to the <a href="sdc-questionnaire.html">base SDC questionnaire profile</a> that support
    adaptive questionnaires.  This profile identifies which core elements and extensions must be supported and highlights other elements that, while not 
    required, may be relevant to the adaptive questionnaire use-case.  Further information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance on on 
    the elements and extensions included in the profile can be found on the <a href="adaptive.html">Adaptive Forms</a> page.
