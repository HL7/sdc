  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile expands adds additional constraints and extensions to the <a href="sdc-questionnaire.html">base SDC questionnaire profile</a> that support
    extracting information from questionnaire responses and producing other FHIR resources.  This profile identifies which core elements and extensions must 
    be supported and highlights other elements that, while not required, may be relevant to the questionnaire response data extraction use-case.  Further 
    information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance on on the elements and extensions included in the profile can be found on the 
    <a href="extraction.html">Data Extraction</a> page.
